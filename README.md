# MkCheck
<strong>*s1l3nt78*</strong>

# Functions

  MCheck is used to check MikroTik Routers for:
  <br />
     <em>-winbox_auth_bypass_creds_disclosure
  <br />
     -routeros_jailbreak</em>
  <br />
  <br />
  If routersploit module confirms if the Mikrotik device is vulnerable and if found - displays login credentials
  <br />
  Which must be entered into <strong><em>scripts/miko.py</em></strong> for MkCheck's auto shell module to correctly work.
  <br />
  <br />
    <strong>Change These:</strong>
    <strong>*************</strong>
    <br />
    <em> username = "<strong>admin</strong>"
 <br />
         password = "<strong>admin</strong>"</em>
  <br />
  <br />
  The main function auto spawns ssh sessions on the compromised targets to enumerate the Network Access Point name from IP
  <br>
    This is done through <strong><em>command = "/system identity print"</em></strong>
    <br />
    You can change the value of the command run in order to enumerate different data.
    <br />
    -Once the Network AP Name has been found the attacker can use the IP and login credentials to work with
     Mikrotik Routers config from a web-session.

# USAGE
<br />
  The following values need to be changed in <strong><em>'scripts/miko.py'</em></strong>
 
  For the Checker module to word correctly. Target host is set dynamically during the scan.
  <br />
  <br />
  -The user must create the <strong><em>'scripts/tiks.txt'</em></strong> list with MikroTik Router IP's.
  <br />
  Current <em>'scripts/tiks.txt'</em> does not contain valid MikroTik Router IP's. <strong>(STRICTLY EXAMPLE)</strong>
  <br />
  -Easiest way to do this is using Shodan for Vuln searching.
     or with nMap using the following command.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong><em># sudo nmap -vv -O -A -Pn -p 80,8291 111.11.11.1/24</em></strong>
    <br />
    This will scan the given IP block for all online devices and check if the appropriate services are running and vulnerable
    <br />
    <br />
    Once the attacker has a specific netblock <eg. 111.69.145.1/24>, the best way to create the list is using Microsoft Excel
    As you need to fill in the first block (111.69.145.1), then you can drag the coloum to quickly fill the IP's in the colom.
    Then copy the entire block into the <strong><em>'scripts/tiks.txt'</em></strong> file.
